     BUILDING AND LINKING THE GENERATED CODE WITH THE ALLJOYN LIBRARY

1. Extract the AllJoyn tar file and follow the directions to build it. Make a
note of the path where the headers and library are placed, this will typically
be in the "/dist" directory where the installation was un-tared.
  - The "/inc" directory contains all the header files.
  - The "/lib" directory contains the library files needed for linking.

2. The tool will generate a sample makefile that will compile and link the
generated files. At the top of the makefile there are 3 variables that
affect how the files are compiled. They may need to be modified in order
for the application build correctly. These variables are:

SERVICE_GENERATED: this variable will be set in the makefile when both the
service side and client side code is generated. This variable should not
require modification; in fact, adding or removing it may cause the makefile
to cease functioning.

CLASSNAME: the name of the AllJoyn service class for which the code is
being generated. If you change this, it should be consistent with the
generated code.

DEF_AJN_INSTALL_PATH: defines the path to the AllJoyn installation
directory. This is used by the compiler and linker to find the header and
library files used to build the application(s). If this variable or the
ALLJOYN_INSTALL_PATH veriable is defined in the invoking shell it will NOT be
overridden by default in the makefile.  If the variable(s) are not set then
make will fail. This should be modified to point to the actual installation
path. An example installation path is:

/usr/src/alljoyn/build/linux/x86/release/dist

3. Once the AllJoyn path is set, the makefile will compile and link the
generated code and create the executable "Client" as well as the
executable "Service" if the service side code was generated.

4. In order to run the client (i.e. Client) the AllJoyn daemon
and the corresponding service both need to be running. If the service was
generated the daemon needs to be running, before launching the service
(i.e. Service).
