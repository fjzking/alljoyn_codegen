				 KNOWN ISSUES

1 Multi-dimensional arrays are not supported and varient argument types 
  have very limited support.

  ajgen supports single dimentional but not multi-dimentional arrays.  i.e. 
  an array of an array.
  
  Variants are only supported if they are the only element in the 
  signature. Variants inside a container type are not supported.  Variants 
  also require the use of the MsgArg library.

2 The *ClientHandlers.cc file is generated even when there are no signals.

3 Limited annotation support

  Currently only two annotations are supported:
    org.freedesktop.DBus.Method.NoReply
      This causes the annotated method not to send a reply from the service
      side, and for the client side not to wait for a reply.
      
    org.alljoyn.Bus.Item.IsSecure
      This will mark the annotated item (currently only interfaces) as
      secure.  This will cause signals to be authenticated and encrypted,
      and require that method invocations be authenticated and encrypted.

  All other annotations are ignored.

4 Only Linux is supported

  Currently the tool is only supported on Linux systems, and only generates
  code that is executable on a Linux system.  It is possible that it may
  work on other systems but that is not supported.

5 Limited "runnable" support

  The tool supports a feature where the generated code will be not only
  build-able, but will actually be runnable (using the --runnable command
  line flag).  This support is currently limited to supporting the
  following:

  1) Setting default values for all supported types, that is method
     invocations will have all of their in parameters initialized before
     the method is invoked.
  2) Invoking all methods and signals as well as setting and getting all
     properties. 
  3) Printing a message when each of these events happen both in the client
     and service applications.  For example, if a client invokes a method
     foo(), the client application will generate output indicating that foo()
     is being invoked.
  4) All "in" arguments and "out" arguments are randomly assigned a valid value
     for all data types. If a method is invoked it will print the values 
     that were sent to it and print which values it is returning to the caller.
     If no values were sent or no values are being returned nothing will be 
     printed beyond the code indicating the method was invoked. 
  5) Signals are sent from one of the method generated in the code. Signals 
     will not be invoked if no methods are found in the XML.

  It does not currently allow modification of the default values.
  
6 Variant type for "runnable"

  Variants will be treated as an unsigned int array. For example a dictionary 
  of variants is treated as just an unsigned int array and not as a dictionary
  of unsigned int arrays.
  
7 Arguments and Properties cannot have the name "status"

  Method and signal arguments as well as properties cannot be named "status"
  because that is a local QStatus variable being used by the code.

8 The -e Switch

  If the XML contains no object and the -e switch is specified, no object
  will be generated.

9 There is no command line option to specify the Session Port

  The session port is defined in BusAttachmentMgr.h with a default value of 42.
  Developers must manually change this if they wish to use a different value.
